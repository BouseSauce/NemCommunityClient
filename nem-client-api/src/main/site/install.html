<title>NEM Community Client - Install Page</title>

<body>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This page is for testing purposes only.
<p>The logic to start the NCC via WebStart has to be incorporated into the official NEM Site from which the latest code will be deployed.
</p><p>
</p><p>It is important to note, that Oracle not yet fully supports the automatic installation of Java 8.<br>In case that you are directed to 
a Java download for Java 7, please <strong>ignore that version</strong> and download the Java 8 from the following Java page.
</p><p><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html">Official Oracle Java8 Download page</a></p>
<p>Please pay also attention that you select the correct version (64Bit or 32Bit). The bit version is not dependent from the Operating Version you are using but from the browser.
<strong>If the browser you're using is 32-bit, then please install a 32-bit version of Java8</strong>.</p>
<p>Some browsers will show a dialog whether to download or to start a program. <strong>Chrome</strong> is one of those browsers, please follow
the solution <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_12036296_configure-chrome-open-jnlp-files.html">here</a>.
<p>If you are on Mac, even if the application is signed by an official certificate, security settings are blocking JavaWebStart. <br>
Unfortunately, you have to adjust the security settings. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19767394/unidentified-developer-for-java-web-start-application-on-os-x">Please read this article.</a></p>
